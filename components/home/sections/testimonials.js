      "Seller is very responsive and open to corrections. Seller spent time reviewing products and making the necessary corrections in order for the product to work correctly. There are still many corrections to be done, however, I have no fear of this seller as he is truthful to his words and actions. I recommend that other buyers should contact him and his team and be patient to work because they take their time to sort out the details of any job order. Still looking for more work to be done.",

      "Eng Khattak and his team are dedicated developers. They took their time to redo and unscramble a dirty and exp[ottational job done for me by a gig called Fasil who happens to also be a developer on Fiverr. Engr. Khattak and his team are very loyal and honest to the point that I am no longer threatened to go on Fiverr. I recommend this team for a thorough and proficient job is you are looking to develop a large scale website and applications.",
